## Real-time FM Receiver: SDR for Mono/Stereo Audio and RDS

The project's main objective is to navigate a complex specification and develop an understanding of the challenges that must be addressed for the real-time implementation of a computing system operating in a form factor-constrained environment.

A detailed project description is available in the project [document](doc/3dy4-project-2025.pdf). The unique constraints for each group, including different modes of operation (i.e., custom sample rates), are available [here](doc/3dy4-constraints-group-35.pdf).

For the workflow used in the last lab, check the [flow](doc/cmake-build-flow.md) overview. To build the executables in debug mode, refer to the [debug](doc/cmake-build-debug.md) overview. To debug your program with command-line arguments or real-time data, check this additional [info](doc/gdb-command-line.md).

All project source code must be submitted before 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 27. The project cross-examinations and oral presentations will take place during the week of March 31, and the detailed final project report is due before 7 p.m. on Friday, April 4.
