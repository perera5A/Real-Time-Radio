## Real-time FM Receiver: SDR for Mono/Stereo Audio and RDS

The project's main objective is to navigate a complex specification and develop an understanding of the challenges that must be addressed for the real-time implementation of a computing system operating in a form factor-constrained environment.

A detailed project description is available in the project [document](project-group-35-wednesday-main/doc/3dy4-project-2025.pdf). The unique constraints for each group, including different modes of operation (i.e., custom sample rates), are available [here](project-group-35-wednesday-main/doc/3dy4-constraints-group-35.pdf).

For the workflow used in the last lab, check the [flow](project-group-35-wednesday-main/doc/cmake-build-flow.md) overview. To build the executables in debug mode, refer to the [debug](project-group-35-wednesday-main/doc/cmake-build-debug.md) overview. To debug your program with command-line arguments or real-time data, check this additional [info](project-group-35-wednesday-main/doc/gdb-command-line.md).
